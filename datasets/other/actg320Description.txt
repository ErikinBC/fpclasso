DESCRITPTIVE ABSTRACT:
The data come from a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that compared the
three-drug regimen of indinavir (IDV), open label zidovudine (ZDV) or
stavudine (d4T) and lamivudine (3TC) with the two-drug regimen of
zidovudine or stavudine and lamivudine in HIV-infected patients (Hammer
et al., 1997).  Patients were eligible for the trial if they had no more
than 200 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter and at least three months of
prior zidovudine therapy.  Randomization was stratified by CD4 cell
count at the time of screening.  The  primary  outcome  measure  was
time  to  AIDS  defining event or death.  Because efficacy results met a
pre-specified level of significance at an interim analysis, the trial
was stopped early.
